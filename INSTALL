#+STARTUP: showall

CLark currently only targets SBCL, but I am not averse to porting it,
or having it ported, to another (free) Common Lisp implementation.

* Requirements

  - [[http://sbcl.org][SBCL]]
  - [[http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-sqlite/][cl-sqlite]]

  The easiest way to install ~cl-sql~ would be to use [[http://quicklisp.org/beta/][quicklisp]]. Once
  you have that set-up it should be a matter of:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (ql:quickload "sqlite")
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Installation

  To install, just:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    make && sudo make install
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  To specify a different install location use the =DESTDIR= environment
  variable, like:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    make install DESTDIR=/usr/local/clark
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Otherwise it will install to ~/usr/local~ by default.
