* v0.1.1

  - Any errors that are caught will now exit with status code 1. This
    makes it easier for other programs, like Conkeror, to determine
    if an action was succesful. This does not yet happen if an
    uncaught exception occurs.

  - Errors are now printed to ~stderr~ more consistently.

  - Fixed a bug that would cause an exception if the =XDG_DATA_HOME= or
    =XDG_CONFIG_HOME= were not set.

  - Removed the McCLIM dependency. It will be back, but is not used
    at the moment, so it should not be required.

  - Add ~NEWS~, ~CONTRIBUTING~, ~INSTALL~ and a ~js/README.org~.

  - Fixed a bug that would cause an infinite loop with unrecognized
    command-line options.

* Changes since Markam

  - Add command system. Instead of trying to figure out if we're
    searching or adding a new URL from the arguments use =add= and
    =search= commands.

  - Add =edit=, =exists=, =remove= and =set-tags= commands.

  - =help= will show a list of available commands and switches, and can
    show a help message for each available command.

** Conkeror interface

   - Add commands for the =edit=, =exists=, =remove= and =set-tags= commands.

   - Add indicator for the mode-line which shows whether or not the
     current URL had been bookmarked in markam.
